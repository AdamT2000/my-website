                <h2> Hello!</h2>
                <p> This is my CIS155 create your own website project. It has gone through several changes which I implemented
                    as the class has progressed. I originally started with a green sidebar but I found it to be quite ugly so 
                    exchanged it for a much more civilized top bar with colored buttons. I thought it made the website extremely
                    easier to both navigate and brought the design from a mid 90s design to one of the early 2000s. <br> <br>
    
                    I've made a few pages of random interests I have where I get motivated and decide to create a webpage.
                    These include silly gags from my friend group, to interests regarding my own keyboard. I even tried to create
                    a bulleten board which wound up not actually working as I don't have the expertice to construct a PHP backend at
                    the current time, I might try to at some point as it seems like a really cool thing to do, though I don't 
                    know if I want to dedicate a large part of my time to engineering an active website off of github since it would
                    add several extra factors and at the end of the day this is a project for a grade. I hope you enjoy my website!
