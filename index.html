                <h2> Hello!</h2>
                <p> This is my CIS155 create your own website project. It has gone through several changes which I implemented
                    as the class has progressed. I originally started with a green sidebar but I found it to be quite ugly so 
                    exchanged it for a much more civilized top bar with colored buttons. The website has quite a few pages due to it serving as a really cool way to procrastinate on my other work, though most of it consists of rants on random topics. <br> <br>
                    
                    I designed this website due to my relative dislike of modern web design, which utilizes pictures and animated elements 
                    which distract from the actual purpose of a website. I designed this with the intent to provide a clean reading experience 
                    with simplified elements as opposed to leveraging image elements in an attempt to make something that doesn't need 
                    to be complicated. Why suck 30mb of images for button layouts on each page when there are simpler methods that provide 
                    a similar (albeit less flashy) user experience. As long as colors are picked wisely, fonts are nice and the layout of 
                    the actual site is visually pleasing, I see no reason for the majority of websites to bloat everything with unnecessary 
                    scrolling elements. Some of my inspiration for the design of this website came from parsing through old MySpace templates
                    and using them to inspire interesting elements (IE: marquee elements), while others come from me just poking around at CSS until something stuck. The headers specifically are in my opinion really cool but I fear they distance everything from that old Geocities/MYSpace look. <br> <br>

                    Also, the mobile view entirely breaks this asthetic, I did my best not to use any JQuery tricks for the mobile view but it does detract from the overall usability of the website on mobile. But in all honesty I don't forsee that being used too often so it's much more of an afterthought. <br> <br>
                    
                    I hope you enjoy my website!
