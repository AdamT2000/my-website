                Hello! I'm Adam and I made this webpage solely for my CIS155 Web Development class to demonstrate my abilities using HTML and CSS. The website was thought up and designed due me being short on ideas, when i got into a slightly heated discussion with my friend regarding keyboards, where I argued that Model M keyboards are the best keyboards ever made. This gave me the idea of creating a rather simple informational website that explains everything there is to know about these keyboards.
            </p>
            <h2> The Design </h2>
            <p>
                I designed this website due to my relative dislike of modern web design, which utilizes pictures and animated elements which distract from the actual purpose of a website. I designed this with the intent to provide a clean reading experience with simplified elements as opposed to leveraging image elements in an attempt to make something that doesnâ€™t need to be complicated. Why suck 30mb of images for button layouts on each page when there are simpler methods that provide a similar (albeit less flashy) user experience. As long as colors are picked wisely, fonts are nice and the layout of the actual site is visually pleasing, I see no reason for the majority of websites to bloat everything with unnecessary scrolling elements.
