                <h2>I have been playing breath of the wild</h2>
                <p>with the release of a new game, Tears of the Kingdom, I realized I was only about halfway through BOTW so I decieded to put a significant amount of time into beating the game, it is a REALLY good game with a ton of depth and it is incredible that such a game runs on the Switch at all. I would write about how awesome the game is and it's amazing story line, but by doing so I would ruin the entire experience for anyone who might want to play it. So if you are someone who enjoys playing 3d games with exellent combat mechanics and a massive amount of content? This is the game for you. While it is still about $60 at gamestop, it is incredibly easy to sink 100+ hours in the game. Also once you beat this game, the game's sequel has 2x the content of this game, so once again PLAY THE GAME.</p>
