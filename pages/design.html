                <h2><strong>FOR STARTERS!</strong></h2>
                <p>I'd like to say for starters that I am not a design major, or anything even close to that. I am simply a 19 year old CS major who has some rather strong opinions on something I know nothing about, so that's what this all is. That being said, read at your own risk</p>

                <h2>Modern Design?</h2>
                <p>Modern design trends really rub me the wrong way. Youtube's slow decent from a well designed UI to something that genuinely pains me to use exemplifies my issues with modern design, so I will use it as an example when I need to. My second silly example is Microsoft Windows, an operating system which at one point held a rather consistent and pleasent experience now holds a hodgepodge of different eras of design, none of which flow together or work in a consistent fashion. There are too many websites that crutch on laggy scrolling images and massive unnecessary popups which should've stayed in the 90s.</p>
                
                <h2>Well, what's wrong with Windows?</h2>
                <p>Let's talk about that, I grew up using Windows XP until around 2015 when I switched to 7, then to 10. I can safely say that design alone, the perfect design lies between XP and 7. Here are some examples.</p>

                <h3>Windows 2000</h3>
                <h4>"Classic Windows"</h4>
                <img src="img/Des_Win2000.webp" alt="an image of windows 2000">
                <p>The classic look of Windows, seen from '95 all the way through some server versions in 2008. Its clean, easy to read, but does suffer from being both hard on the eyes due to the beige and white. This is a classic look however, which does have its charm but most people would rather gouge their eyes out then return to this.</p>

                <h3>Windows XP</h3>
                <h4>The "Luna" Style</h4>
                <img src="img/Des_WindowsXP.png" alt="an image of windows XP">
                <p>Windows XP took everything learned from the classic design and made it colorful and easy to look at. With it's vibrant color pallet it brings back so many memories. The operating sytem itself lasted for over 10 years and some design elements live on.</p>
