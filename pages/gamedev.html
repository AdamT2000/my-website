                <h2>I like game development</h2>
                <p>This is actually somewhat false. While I have many game ideas, I tend to find myself hitting a brick wall after a week. I've tried Unity, Godot, Gamemaker 1.4, and a few oddball engines through the years but have yet to produce an actually good game out of it. Despite all of that I do still enjoy it as a hobby. I am going to compile a list of game engines i've thought about using and the reasons for NOT using them</p>

                <img src="img/GD_Unity.png">
                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>The gold standard of most indie and small studio game production. I however, do not really like using Unity. For one, it is really difficult to properly organize your game, as well as requiring you to understand vector math in order to do most basic tasks. Theoretically it can create really complex and well done games, though most production unity games (Rust/Tarkov) suffer from being massive glitch fests that hold a particular unresponsive feel that I personally do not like.</p>

                <img src="img/GD_Godot.webp">
                <h3>GoDot</h3>
                <p>oMg HaVe YoU tRiEd GoDoT????? <br> theoretically this engine is good, it's open source and doesn't have any royalties, but switching to it seems like a huge pain. It also seems rather buggy and I don't know if I could ever bring myself to using it. The concept is wonderful, being really creator focused, but in execution I don't know if it's all there yet.</p>

                <img src="img/GD_Gamemaker.jpg">
                <h3>Gamemaker</h3>
                <p>This engine is very outdated, and there is a newer version. However the new version costs a subscription fee every month and since I already own the 2018 version which cost a one time fee (you are unable to buy it anymore). It works fine but uses a weird programming language called "GML", it functions kind of like JavaScript but is missing many features that full programming languages contain. However, it's UI does make a lot of sense and it feels easy to make a game in, it is not easy to make a great game in it, but producing a prototype that plays and runs is rather easy.</p>

                <h3>What I'm actually doing</h3>
                <p>I honestly have no clue what I'm doing game dev wise, about once a week my ideas change and idk what to do about it. I'm probably going to use gamemaker since I own a perpetual license for it but I am confused as to what to do about it but i'll probably just keep poking at websites and stuff til I get an actual idea of what to do.</p>
