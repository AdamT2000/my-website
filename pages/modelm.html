                <h2>What are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a paragraph which describes in excruciating and painstaking detail about a specific type of computer keyboard created in 1985. They have been made by a few different companies, most notably:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IBM (1985-1991)</li>
                    <li>Lexmark (1991-1999)</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/SFNT">Unicomp</a> (1999 - current)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2> What's so special about them?</h2>
                <p>Model Ms utilize a special kind of key switch known as a buckling spring switch</p>

                    This differs from standard keyboards which commonly use either rubber domes or modern mechanical switches, which have significantly simplified mechanisms. You might be asking yourself why some typists stand buy 1980s technology as the greatest typing device when over 40 years of innovation has happened, and the answer to that is that the buckling spring design is simply perfect in sound, feel, and longevity. While many have tried to innovate the keyboard, these "innovations" are usually cost cuts in disguise, giving the user an inferior product. While to the majority of the world, the quality of modern desktop keyboards are adequate or not concidered at all, which is a shame in a modern throwaway culture.

                <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
                <p>
                    I bought my brand new Unicomp Model M keyboard back in 2021 and have used it exclusively since then. I really like it, though it's loud noises tend to bother those around me, which is why in the past I have brought it to classes and coffee shops.
